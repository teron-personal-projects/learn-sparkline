 * arguments. This allows requests from all domains.
 * 
 * In production, you should specify the domains that are allowed
 * to make requests to the server. This is done by passing an object
 * to the cors() function with the origin property set to an array
 * of domains.
 * 
 * If you use a Proxy in the frontend, you should set the origin
 * property to the domain of the frontend. This is because the
 * requests from the frontend will be made to the Proxy, which
 * will then forward the requests to the server.

 * done by passing an object to the cors() function with the
 * origin property set to the domain of the frontend.
