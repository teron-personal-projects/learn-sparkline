# Typescript Notes

## What is typescript?

Typescript adds additional syntax to help check for errors. Typescript is about "Type Safety". It makes
sure you are using the right "type" in the right way. 

Typescript job is to handle "Static Checking". It checks your code while you are writing it, it gives feedback
about possible errors. This means the errors I caught before the code hits the runtime.
